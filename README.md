# 👋 Greetings!  

I'm **Vanessa**, a Ph.D. in Genetics and Postdoctoral Fellow at *BC Cancer Research Institute (Vancouver, Canada)*. I have 7+ years of experience in NGS data analysis, from read alignment and variant calling to annotation and ACMG/AMP-based interpretation. I develop bioinformatics pipelines in R, Python, and Bash, integrating multi-omics data to uncover molecular mechanisms of lung cancer and drive precision medicine innovations.

## 💼 Expertise  
- Big Data Analysis | R/RStudio | Linux/Shell | Python | Machine Learning | Data Management
- DNA & RNA Sequencing | Genetics & Genomics | Spatial Multi-omics | Variant Calling
- Immunology | Tumor Microenvironment | Lung Cancer Biology

## 🔬 Current Focus  
I work at the intersection of **genomics, data science, and translational oncology**, developing computational pipelines to analyze DNA/RNA sequencing, perform variant calling, and integrate multi-omics data (bulk, single-cell, and spatial). My goal is to translate molecular insights into precision biomarkers for early detection and personalized therapy.  

## 🏆 Awards & Recognition (selected)
- POSIT 2025 Award – presented by POSIT (formerly RStudio), the organization behind R and RStudio, recognizing excellence in computational reproducibility and open-source contributions.
- BC Cancer Rising Stars Fellowship (First Year) – a highly competitive program recognizing outstanding postdoctoral fellows across BC Cancer.
- Canadian Institutes of Health Research - Travel Award (2025) – one of only 21 recipients nationwide, supporting Canadian researchers presenting internationally.

## 🌱 Outreach & Teaching
Beyond research, I’m passionate about equitable access to bioinformatics education.
I have participated in and co-organized programs aimed at teaching genomics and data analysis to underserved students in Brazil, fostering capacity building in regions with limited access to computational biology training.
